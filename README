This is repo contains code for scraping lyrics off azlyrics.com.
Nothing more, nothing less.
The program outputs a file with the lyrics of the song in it.
The current version can be used only to scrape lyrics of azlyrics.com.

I opted for azlyrics.com because of the really simple site structure.

Conventions used:

1. PEP8
2. camelCase since it looks cool.
